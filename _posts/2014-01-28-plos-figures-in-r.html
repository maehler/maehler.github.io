<p>I'm preparing a manuscript for PLOS ONE and saw this in the figure guidelines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Figure text must be in Arial font, between 8 and 12 point.</p></blockquote>
<p>Easy, I thought. Just a matter of specifying a font family in the device I print to.</p>
<p>Think again.</p>
<p>Apparently, R does not support using different font definitions. Of course I'm not the first person to encounter this problem. In an <a href="http://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2013/09/09/preparing-figures-for-plos-one-with-r/">excellent post by Gavin Simpson</a> he explains how to come around this, and even to embed fonts in PDFs printed by R. In short, take a look at the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/extrafont/index.html"><code>extrafont</code> package</a>. It enables you to use fonts on your system in your R figures.</p>
<p>To get this to work properly, I had to specify one single directory to look when importing the fonts in since I apparently had multiple copies of Arial on my system (Mac OSX 10.9). This can be done easily by using <code>font_import(path=c('/Library/Fonts'), recursive=FALSE)</code> to ensure that only one copy is used.</p>
