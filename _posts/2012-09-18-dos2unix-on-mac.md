In Linux there's a nice little tool called `dos2unix` that converts those 
nasty Windows line breaks into Unix line breaks. This is not available in OSX, 
but it is possible to do it with [`tr`][1]:

{% highlight bash %}
tr '\r' '\n' < file_to_convert.txt > output.txt
{% endhighlight %}

Nice and simple, and it seems to work just fine.
