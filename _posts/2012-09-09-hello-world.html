<p>So, once again I create a blog using Wordpress. This is not only a blog, but also a place where I can showcase my work. My hope is to update this page on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I chose Wordpress since it will be much easier to maintain than my own crappy code would be. I also hope to learn a bit about Wordpress, and how I could incorporate it into my future work as well.</p>
