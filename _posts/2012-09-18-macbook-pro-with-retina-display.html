<p>Wow! I had heard that the retina displays were nice, but I couldn't imagine how nice. I just got my work computer, a 15" MacBook Pro with retina display, and I've only been working with it for 15 minutes. Still, when I look at my old 13" MacBook, it looks absolutely dreadful. My economy won't survive this awakening...</p>
