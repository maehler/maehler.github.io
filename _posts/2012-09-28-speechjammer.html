<p>I still don't have an Internet connection in my apartment, but now it should be on it's way!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I found that this years <a href="http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2012">Ig Nobel Prize</a> in acoustics was awarded to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qurihara/top-english" target="_blank">Kazutaka Kurihara</a> and <a href="http://mobiquitous.com/" target="_blank">Koji Tsukada</a> for creating the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6106">SpeechJammer</a>. It's a device that disturbs people's speech by simply playing back what the person is saying, but with a tiny delay. I've experienced this myself working at the technical support of a major swedish ISP. Sometimes I could hear my own voice in the headset, with a delay, and it was tremendously difficult trying to talk to the customer without stuttering.</p>
<p>If I only thought of this application back then (2007), I could've been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize instead. Ah, well...</p>
