<p>So, it's the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(coffee_break)">fika</a> for the semester at <a href="http://clicumu.se"><abbr title="Computational Life Science Cluster">CLiC</abbr></a>, but also my last before I move to Norway. It's my turn to bake, so I decided to go with a <a href="http://www.kokaihop.se/recept/morotskaka-i-langpanna-2?selectedServings=25">carrot cake</a>. Hopefully it will be well received! Pictures to come...</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The carrot cake is no more, and unfortunately, I didn't manage to snap any picture of it. Maybe next time...</p>
