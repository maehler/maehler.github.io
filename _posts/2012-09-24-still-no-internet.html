<p>I'm still waiting to get the stuff I need to set up an Internet connection in my apartment. I couldn't imagine how restless I would become without an Internet connection, but it hasn't been all that bad. I managed to read through book six in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(series)" target="_blank">Dark Tower series by Stephen King</a>, and I'm halfway through the seventh (and last) book. I highly recommend this series if you're a fan of the work of Stephen King, and even if you're not. I also managed to pick up an old hobby of mine; drawing. If I feel confident enough, maybe I'll post some of my drawings here.</p>
<p>Next week I will go to Umeå for some meetings, and a crash course in RNAseq data analysis. It'll be nice to come back "home" and see my girlfriend and her dog. Not that I don't like it here. I feel quite at home here in Norway. The people are friendly, and the infrastructure is nice. There's just one thing that I find really annoying: most supermarkets are closed on Sundays. That sucks.</p>
