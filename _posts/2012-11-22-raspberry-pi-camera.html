<p>My <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs">Raspberry Pi</a> has been collecting dust for far too long now. I've had some projects in mind, but I haven't found any motivation for realising them yet. Now however, the Raspberry Pi camera is on its way! Hopefully it will be available <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=23370&amp;p=218321#p218321">sometime in the first half of next year</a>, and I want one. For a while I've been thinking that I want to try to implement some machine learning methods for e.g. facial recognition, just for fun. This seems like a golden opportunity! It shoots 1080p at 30 fps according to <a href="http://www.designspark.com/blog/the-world-s-first-public-demo-of-the-raspberry-pi-camera">DesignSpark</a>.</p>

<p>Since I have a webcam in my computer, that should work as well, but I'm having trouble installing the Python bindings for <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/">OpenCV</a>. It feels like I've tried every configuration possible, but I still can't get it to work. If I get some time on my hands I will primarily try to fix that, but the Raspberry Pi camera is a tempting option. Even if I get it to work on my Mac, I will probably buy it anyway.</p>
