So, I'm doing it again. Creating a blog that I probably won't write anything
in, that is. Anyway, I find this a bit more interesting than my previous
attempts. This site was built using [Jekyll][1], a static site generator.
When I first heard about it I realized this was something I had been trying to
achieve for a while; something where I could easily have a common header and
footer for a website and just alter the main content. This is of course possible
using e.g. PHP, but every time I've started such a project, I've ended up
creating all kinds of "nice to have"-features that just ended up messing up the
whole thing. I've also tried using Wordpress, but it's just too bulky for my
needs.


And yes, it's quite fascinating that I haven't found out about this until now.

I even managed to migrate my old Wordpress posts into Jekyll very smoothly using
the [instructions from Hadi Harari][2].

Hopefully this will inspire me to write about my (not so) adventurous life as
a PhD student in bioinformatics.
