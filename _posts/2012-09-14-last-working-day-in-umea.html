<p>This is my last working day here in Umeå for some time. However, it seems like I will return quite soon for some work related stuff.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I'm taking the train to Oslo, a 16 hour trip that I really look forward to... not... I like travelling by train, but 16 hours it a bit too much for my taste. I will try to get some sleep, but I doubt that I will succeed. Then I have a bunch of articles that I can entertain myself with.</p>
<p>Next entry will probably be posted from an apartment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski,_Norway" target="_blank">Ski</a> where I will be living in the near future. It's about 9 km from the University in Ås, but there is a train station nearby, so I won't need to walk or ride the bike I don't have.</p>
<p>I realize that I haven't written anything about the <a href="http://www.umb.no/" target="_new">University in Ås</a>. I will do that a bit later.</p>
