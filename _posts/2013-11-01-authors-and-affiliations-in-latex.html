<p>Oh, that's right, I have a blog. Had almost forgotten about it.</p>
<p>I just faced the problem of setting multiple authors in a LaTeX document together with their affiliations. On top of that, one of the authors had multiple affiliations. Google returned <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/9598/12574" title="Adding more than one author with different affiliation">this excellent answer</a> on <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com" title="TeX">TeX StackExchange</a>. In short; use the <code>authblk</code> package:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false; first-line: 1; highlight: []; html-script: false">
\documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{authblk}

\title{More than one Author with different Affiliations}
\author[1]{Author A\thanks{A.A@university.edu}}
\author[2]{Author D\thanks{D.D@university.edu}}
\author[1,2]{Author E\thanks{E.E@university.edu}}
\affil[1]{Department of Computer Science, \LaTeX\ University}
\affil[2]{Department of Mechanical Engineering, \LaTeX\ University}

\begin{document}
  \maketitle
\end{document}
</pre>
<p><code>\thanks</code> is useful to add footnotes to the authors, in this case their email addresses.</p>
