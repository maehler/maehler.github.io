As of now, I've had Internet in my apartment for a few weeks, and as soon as I 
got it I apparently stopped posting here. Constructive, yeah I know.

Anyhow, today I had my start seminar for my PhD where I introduced my project 
to the rest of the group plus some other people. It went better than I 
expected, and I'm really excited to get started for real. However, there's a 
lot of administrative stuff that has to be solved before I can really dig in.


I really like it at the University. The predecessor to the University of today 
was founded in 1859, and in 2005 it got University status and was renamed to 
the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Some of the buildings are quite old, 
but in a charming way. With narrow corridors and strange floor plans, it was a 
mess finding your way around in the beginning. Just next to my office there's 
actually a small dairy. Sometimes they get cream left over, and it's just to 
go there and fill a bottle. Pretty nice!
