<p>I've never played <a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> (if you don't count my futile attempts at playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicraft">Minicraft</a> on my Windows Phone), but now it seems a (free) version of it is <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2603">coming to the Raspberry Pi</a>. Not only can you play it like the ordinary Minecraft, you can also program it <em>in real time</em>! Check out the video below.</p>

<p>So, if I haven't gotten started with Minecraft yet, this is a golden opportunity for some <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1388">procrastination</a>! It's hopefully going to be released by the end of this year, and I can barely wait!</p>
